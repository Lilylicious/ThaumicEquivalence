An addon to both ProjectE and Thaumcraft! The aim of the addon is to merge the two mods into a more fluid play experience, utilizing one to improve the other. The addon is developed with configs heavily in mind, allowing the user to tweak their experience the way they want. By default, the mod will attempt to keep things relatively balanced.

Thus far, the only features on by default are EMC generation.
